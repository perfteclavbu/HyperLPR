## Chhota Bheem Himalayan Adventure Movie Review: What Critics Say
 
The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, who have praised the animation quality, the action scenes and the entertainment value, but have also criticized the lack of originality, the weak plot and the overemphasis on physical strength. Here are some of the excerpts from the critics' reviews:

> "The writing is deliberately kept conventional and focuses completely on the deeds and misdeeds of Bheem and his gang. The best thing about the movie is that it is kept crisp. At 90 minutes, it never feels heavy. With a sketchy story at its core, its animation has a rich look." - Mohar Basu, Times of India

> "The only thing worth applauding in this largely familiar story is the emphasis on adventure sports. Thankfully, we are told all about the safety measures, even if in a tad-too-preachy voice! Chhota Bheem Himalayan Adventure is amateurish but a roller coaster ride that entertains to the hilt." - Economic Times

> "Awesome Animation i liked movie fully the fantastic animation and thrilling adventures in snow by chhota bheem made crazy to my kids and are very happy and enjoyed very much. Must Watch movie by all." - User review on IMDb
